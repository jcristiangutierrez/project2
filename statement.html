    <p>As an adolescent I have always been fascinated with space and the endless void that is space. I always found it interesting how shooting stars thousands of miles per hour. These objects are still so big but with a blink of the eye they can be missed. Just traveling throughout the galaxy seeing the wonders of this universe.

<p>  For my Project 2 I wanted to emulate space and a shooting star. I explored various libraries from easel.js, p5.js, tween.js and more. I ultimately settled with paper.js, p5.clickable.js, star.js, and more. What I wanted to create was a really fast paced user controlled shooting star that is controlled by the mouse. I wanted to really have the use of bright colors that create a nice radial gradient, as well aimed to create an endless space because a shooting star has an endless amount of area to manuever. It was really interesting to learn about all the libraries that are available. It is motivating to see what you are able to create.
